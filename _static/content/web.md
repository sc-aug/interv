* What are differences between REST and other webservices.
    + SOAP vs REST
    + [ref](https://restfulapi.net/statelessness/) Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in **complete isolation**. When the client makes an HTTP request, **it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill that request**. **The server never relies on information from previous requests**. If that information was important, the client would have sent it again in this request.
